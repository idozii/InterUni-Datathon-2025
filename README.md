# Ski Resort Analytics: 2025-2026 Season Planning

## Project Overview

This datathon project analyzes ski resort data to identify optimal timing and locations for the 2025-2026 ski season. The analysis is based on historical visitation patterns, weather conditions, and resort characteristics to provide strategic recommendations for ski holiday planning.

## Data Sources

- **Climate Data**: Temperature, precipitation, snowfall for various ski resorts (2010-2025)
- **Visitation Data**: Historical visitor numbers by resort and week (2014-2024)
- **Resort Characteristics**: Elevation, lifts, capacity, and other infrastructure metrics
- **External Factors**: Holiday periods, COVID impacts, and climate change trends

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation & Integration

#### Visitation Data Processing

- Handled missing values and outliers through forward-filling and statistical imputation
- Created seasonal flags (Early/Mid/Late Season)
- Added holiday week indicators for weeks 2, 7, 8, 13, and 14
- Analyzed yearly totals, weekly averages, and utilization rates by resort

#### Climate Data Processing

- Converted calendar dates to ski season weeks (1-15, starting around June 9th)
- Mapped weather station data to corresponding resorts using a station-to-resort dictionary
- Extracted snow metrics including snowfall intensity and preservation indicators
- Generated temperature-based features and snow depth proxies

#### Data Integration

- Created a comprehensive dataset combining resort, climate, and visitation data
- Generated a multi-dimensional dataset (resort × week × year)
- Flagged outliers including COVID-period anomalies (2020-2022)

#### Feature Engineering

- **Comfort Index**: Combined snow comfort, temperature comfort, and crowd density
- **Affordability Index**: Considered lift costs, accommodation, and transportation
- **Experience Index**: Based on infrastructure, terrain variety, and snow quality
- **Accessibility Index**: Distance-based accessibility from major cities
- **Snow Reliability Index**: Evaluated snow quality and consistency

### 2. Exploratory Analysis

#### Seasonal Trends Analysis

- **Weekly Visitation Patterns**: Identified peak visitor weeks (typically weeks 7, 8, 13)
- **Climate-Visitor Correlation**: Found moderate correlation between comfort metrics and visitation
- **Holiday Impact**: Quantified ~15% visitor premium during holiday periods
- **COVID Impact**: Measured significant visitor reduction during pandemic years
- **Resort Performance**: Compared resorts across multiple quality dimensions

#### Resort Comparison & Trade-off Analysis

- **Performance Matrix**: Created comprehensive resort evaluation framework
- **Snow Reliability Rankings**: Identified top resorts for snow quality
- **Overcrowding Analysis**: Classified resorts as premium, hidden gems, or overrated
- **Accessibility Analysis**: Evaluated resorts based on distance from Sydney and Melbourne
- **Trade-off Matrix**: Balanced affordability, experience, and snow quality

### 3. Predictive Modeling

#### Time Series Forecasting

- Used ARIMA models to forecast visitor numbers, comfort index, and snow reliability
- Generated 2025-2026 season predictions with confidence intervals
- Adjusted forecasts based on climate change trends and post-COVID recovery patterns

#### Clustering Analysis

- Applied K-means clustering to identify resort categories
- Discovered "hidden gem" resorts with excellent snow but lower crowds
- Categorized resorts into premium, value, and snow-focused segments

#### Regression Analysis

- Built Random Forest model to predict visitation based on multiple features
- Achieved MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) of approximately 46%
- Identified temperature, snow depth, holiday status as key predictors

#### Comprehensive 2025-2026 Predictions

- Generated detailed week-by-week forecasts for all resorts
- Analyzed year-over-year changes in key metrics
- Created resort-specific prediction summaries

### 4. Strategic Recommendations

#### Recommendation Engine

- Developed multi-criteria optimization for personalized recommendations
- Created scoring system based on user preferences (value, premium, snow-focused)
- Generated top resort × week combinations for 2025-2026

#### Scenario-Based Recommendations

- **For Snow Quality Seekers**: Best weeks and resorts for optimal snow conditions
- **For Budget Travelers**: Best value periods with lower costs and good conditions
- **For Experience-Focused Travelers**: Premium resorts with best overall experience

#### Risk Assessment

- Quantified prediction uncertainty and weather variability
- Evaluated crowd forecast reliability
- Provided confidence intervals for all recommendations

## Key Findings

1. **Optimal Timing**:
   - Peak visitor weeks (7, 8, 13) don't always align with best snow conditions
   - Holiday periods see approximately 15% more visitors but offer similar snow quality
   - Early/late season offers better value with 20-30% fewer crowds

2. **Resort Selection**:
   - Premium resorts (Thredbo, Perisher, Mt. Hotham) offer best overall experience
   - Budget-friendly options (Mt. Baw Baw, Selwyn) provide best value
   - Snow-focused options (Falls Creek, Mt. Buller) deliver most reliable conditions

3. **Climate Impact**:
   - Strong correlation between temperature and visitation patterns
   - Snow reliability is more predictive of visitor satisfaction than raw snowfall
   - 2025-2026 season shows 3-5% projected increase in overall visitation

4. **Value Optimization**:
   - Visiting mid-week provides 20-30% lower crowds with minimal snow quality compromise
   - Traveling outside school holidays offers best value-for-money
   - Hidden gems (Mt. Stirling, Charlotte Pass) offer excellent experience-to-cost ratio

## Model Performance

- **Random Forest Regression**:
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): ~46%
  - R² Score: 0.78
  - Key predictors: Temperature, snow depth, holiday status, and historical visitation

- **Time Series Forecasting**:
  - ARIMA models for visitor numbers, comfort index, and snow reliability
  - Adjusted for seasonal patterns and long-term trends
  - Incorporated climate change projections for 2025-2026

## Strategic Recommendations for 2025-2026

### For Snow Quality Seekers

- Best timing: Weeks 4, 5, 9 at Falls Creek and Mt. Hotham
- Avoid holiday crowds by visiting early August (Week 9) instead of late July
- Best value snow-focused resort: Mt. Buller in Week 5

### For Budget Travelers

- Best value weeks: 3, 4, 11
- Most affordable resorts with good conditions: Mt. Baw Baw and Selwyn
- Optimal strategy: Book mid-week stays in early-mid July

### For Experience-Focused Travelers

- Premium resorts with best overall experience: Thredbo and Perisher
- Best timing for premium experience: Weeks 5-6
- Hidden gems with excellent experience-to-cost ratio: Mt. Stirling, Charlotte Pass

## Technical Implementation

- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels
- **Analysis Techniques**: Time series analysis, machine learning, clustering, data visualization
- **Model Evaluation**: MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) for scale-independent evaluation
