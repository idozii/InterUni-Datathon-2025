## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation & Integration

#### Visitation Data Processing

- Handled missing values and outliers through forward-filling and statistical imputation
- Created seasonal flags (Early/Mid/Late Season)
- Added holiday week indicators for weeks 2, 7, 8, 13, and 14
- Analyzed yearly totals, weekly averages, and utilization rates by resort

#### Climate Data Processing

- Converted calendar dates to ski season weeks (1-15, starting around June 9th)
- Mapped weather station data to corresponding resorts using a station-to-resort dictionary
- Extracted snow metrics including snowfall intensity and preservation indicators
- Generated temperature-based features and snow depth proxies

#### Data Integration

- Created a comprehensive dataset combining resort, climate, and visitation data
- Generated a multi-dimensional dataset (resort × week × year)
- Flagged outliers including COVID-period anomalies (2020-2022)

#### Feature Engineering

#### **Comfort Index**: Overall Skiing Experience Quality (0-100 scale)

**Purpose**: Measures how comfortable and enjoyable the skiing experience is, combining snow conditions, weather, and crowd levels.

**Formula**: `Comfort_Index = Snow_Comfort × 0.5 + Temperature_Comfort × 0.3 + Crowd_Comfort × 0.2`

**Components Explained**:

- **Snow_Comfort (50% weight)**: Most important factor for skiing quality
  - `Snow_Making_Days/7 × 40%`: Days per week with artificial snow production (quality assurance)
  - `Snow_Preservation_Days/7 × 30%`: Days per week snow stays intact (natural preservation)
  - `Snow_Accumulation/100 × 30%`: Total snow depth normalized to 0-1 scale
  - *Why this matters*: Good snow is essential for skiing; artificial snow ensures base coverage, preservation indicates temperature stability, accumulation provides depth for varied terrain

- **Temperature_Comfort (30% weight)**: Optimal skiing temperature
  - `100 - abs(Avg_Max_Temp - 2) × 10`
  - *Rationale*: 2°C is ideal skiing temperature (snow stays fresh but not too cold for comfort)
  - *Calculation*: Further from 2°C = lower comfort (0°C = 80 points, 4°C = 80 points, -3°C = 50 points)

- **Crowd_Comfort (20% weight)**: Lower crowds = higher comfort
  - `100 - (Utilization_Rate × 100)`
  - *Example*: 30% utilization = 70 comfort points, 80% utilization = 20 comfort points
  - *Why*: Fewer crowds mean shorter lift lines, less crowded slopes, better overall experience

#### **Affordability Index**: Cost-Effectiveness Measure (0-100 scale)

**Purpose**: Compares total trip costs across resorts, with higher scores indicating better value for money.

**Formula**: `Affordability_Index = 100 - (Total_Cost / max_cost × 100)`

**Cost Calculation**: `Total_Cost = (Lift_Cost × 3) + (Accommodation_Cost × 2) + Transport_Cost`

**Weighting Rationale**:

- **Lift costs ×3**: Multiple days skiing, most significant expense
- **Accommodation ×2**: Multi-night stays typical for ski trips
- **Transport ×1**: One-time cost regardless of trip length

**Normalization**: Costs are scaled against the maximum cost across all resorts, creating a 0-100 scale where:

- 100 = Most affordable option
- 0 = Most expensive option
- 50 = Average cost

#### **Experience Index**: Resort Quality and Infrastructure (0-100 scale)

**Purpose**: Measures the overall skiing experience based on resort facilities, terrain diversity, and snow quality.

**Formula**: `Experience_Index = Infrastructure_Score × 0.4 + Terrain_Variety × 0.3 + Snow_Quality_Score × 0.3`

**Components Breakdown**:

- **Infrastructure_Score (40% weight)**: Resort facilities and capacity
  - `(Lifts/47 × 40%) + (Base_Elevation/1805 × 30%) + (Capacity/15000 × 30%)`
  - *Normalization factors*: 47 lifts, 1805m elevation, 15000 capacity represent maximum values in dataset
  - *Why*: More lifts = less waiting, higher elevation = better snow/views, higher capacity = less crowding

- **Terrain_Variety (30% weight)**: Diversity of skiing options
  - `(Base_Elevation/2000 × 50%) + (Lifts/50 × 50%)`
  - *Logic*: Higher elevation offers varied terrain (glacial, alpine, tree runs), more lifts access diverse areas

- **Snow_Quality_Score (30% weight)**: Natural snow advantage
  - `Snow_Comfort × 0.6 + Base_Elevation/2000 × 0.4`
  - *Reasoning*: Combines actual snow conditions with elevation advantage (higher = more reliable natural snow)

#### **Accessibility Index**: Ease of Reaching and Navigating Resort (0-100 scale)

**Purpose**: Measures how easy it is to reach the resort and move around once there.

**Formula**: `Accessibility_Index = City_Accessibility × 0.6 + Resort_Accessibility × 0.4`

**Components**:

- **City_Accessibility (60% weight)**: Distance from major population centers
  - `100 - (Distance/600 × 100)`
  - *600km baseline*: Represents maximum reasonable driving distance for weekend trips
  - *Example*: 300km distance = 50 accessibility points

- **Resort_Accessibility (40% weight)**: Ease of movement within resort
  - `(Lifts/47 × 100)`
  - *Logic*: More lifts = easier access to different areas, less walking between runs

#### **Snow Reliability Index**: Consistency of Snow Conditions (0-100 scale)

**Purpose**: Predicts how reliable snow conditions will be throughout the season, crucial for trip planning.

**Formula**: `Snow_Reliability_Index = (Snow_Making_Days/7 × 30%) + (Snow_Preservation_Days/7 × 25%) + (Comfortable_Days/7 × 20%) + (Snow_Accumulation/100 × 25%)`

**Component Weights Explained**:

- **Snow_Making_Days (30%)**: Artificial snow capability ensures base coverage
- **Snow_Preservation_Days (25%)**: Natural snow stays intact (temperature stability)
- **Comfortable_Days (20%)**: Days with good skiing weather conditions
- **Snow_Accumulation (25%)**: Raw snow depth for terrain coverage

**Why These Weights**: Snow making is most important for reliability (can always create base), preservation indicates consistent conditions, comfort affects skier satisfaction, and accumulation provides variety in terrain access.
